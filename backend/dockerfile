# Step 1: Use a node base image
FROM node:14-alpine as builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock if using Yarn)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application's code
COPY . .

# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a smaller base image for the production environment
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the built application from the previous stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/build ./build
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/package*.json ./
COPY .env .env

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "build/index.js"]
